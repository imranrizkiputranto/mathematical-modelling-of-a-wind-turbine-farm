# Mathematical Modelling of a Wind Turbine Farm

A wind turbine nacelle was designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 and calculations involving turbine power outputs were carried out. A mathematical model of the wind farm based on four different geographical locations were created in MATLAB which calculated the power output based on factors including the wind speed, density, yaw angle, etc.
